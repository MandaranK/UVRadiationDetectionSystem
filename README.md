# UVRadiationDetectionSystem
Designed to take solar radiation as a voltage input value through the light sensor.
Programmed to convert it into a UV index value, to be displayed and updated on an LCD monitor, in addition to informing the user how much skin protection is needed outside.
The STM32 Microcontroller was programmed in C, using the STM32Cube IDE.
The outer structure was designed in Autodesk AutoCAD and later 3D printed.
